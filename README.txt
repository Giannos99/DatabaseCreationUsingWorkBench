It is a database for an RPG game called Gok. (it is an imaginary one)

The concept is that we have some info, like
Each player can have many characters in the game. A game has a wide range
of characters, a character can have one or more pets to accompany him.
He (the character) is a part of a tribe, has some abilities, and can 
carry items, and gold coins.
The abilities can be natural (strength, speed etc) or magical (different type of
spells). Items have a specific type, and can be either weapons, shields or whatever
a character can aquire during the game.
The character has stats, different worlds exist etc etc.

Based on that information we designed the relational database.
